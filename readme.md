# Flask-Markdown [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brmullikin/flask-markdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brmullikin/flask-markdown) [![Test Coverage](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/brmullikin/flask-markdown/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/brmullikin/flask-markdown)

A fork of [Flask-Markdown](https://github.com/dcolish/flask-markdown) whose goal, ultimately, is to be merged back into the original.

## Why a Fork?

There are 4 reasons/goals for this fork.

1. The original Flask-Markdown was not responding to Issues or Pull Requests.
2. Ensure the repository conforms to pep8 & pep257 standards (prefering pep257 where they conflict), and to convert nose tests into pytest.
3. Conform to current Flask plugins standards.
4. Add in a few minor features.

## TODO

1. Clean up documentation and bad examples in markdown.py
